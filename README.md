# Exblock
Unity VR game where you must destroy dynamically moving blocks/objects with the use of magic/guns/swords.

## [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrmZopn8tsk&feature=emb_title) 

## How to Install and Run
1. Make sure you have Unity 2019.2.6f1 installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open Unity. Unity will now import and compile the new files.
4. Go to “Scenes” folder and load the scene "TargetRange"
5. Click Play and enjoy!
At this point, you should be able to look around and teleport to the different
areas. This is the tutorial stage where you can walk around and read/learn more
about all the weapons. You may test all the weapons here and shoot the objects
that respawn.

To play our demo level, please locate to the red area all the way in the back right of the
map (facing the stair case in the beginning). Hit the Castle Raid button to play the level.
